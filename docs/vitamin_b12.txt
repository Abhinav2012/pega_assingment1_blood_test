UNDERSTANDING VITAMIN B12 DEFICIENCY
AND SYMPTOMS SEEN IN BLOOD TESTS

Vitamin B12 is an essential nutrient required for red blood cell formation,
nerve function, and DNA synthesis. Deficiency of vitamin B12 is common, especially
among vegetarians and older adults, and can lead to serious blood and nerve-related
problems if left untreated.

--------------------------------------------------

WHAT IS VITAMIN B12?

Vitamin B12, also known as cobalamin, is a water-soluble vitamin that helps:
- Produce healthy red blood cells
- Maintain nerve health
- Support brain function
- Prevent anemia

The body does not produce vitamin B12 on its own and must obtain it from food or
supplements.

--------------------------------------------------

NORMAL VITAMIN B12 LEVELS

Vitamin B12 levels are measured through a blood test.

Typical reference ranges:
Normal: 200–900 pg/mL
Borderline: 200–300 pg/mL
Deficient: Below 200 pg/mL

Symptoms may appear even at borderline levels.

--------------------------------------------------

CAUSES OF VITAMIN B12 DEFICIENCY

Common causes include:
- Vegetarian or vegan diet
- Poor absorption due to stomach or intestinal issues
- Pernicious anemia
- Long-term use of acid-reducing medications
- Metformin use
- Aging-related absorption decline

--------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS OF VITAMIN B12 DEFICIENCY

Early symptoms:
- Fatigue and weakness
- Pale skin
- Shortness of breath
- Dizziness

Neurological symptoms:
- Numbness or tingling in hands and feet
- Burning sensation in feet
- Poor balance
- Memory problems
- Difficulty concentrating
- Mood changes or depression

Severe or prolonged deficiency can cause permanent nerve damage.

--------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS SEEN IN BLOOD TESTS

Blood test abnormalities may include:
- Low vitamin B12 levels
- Megaloblastic anemia (large red blood cells)
- Low hemoglobin
- Elevated MCV (mean corpuscular volume)
- Low red blood cell count
- Elevated homocysteine levels

--------------------------------------------------

FOODS RICH IN VITAMIN B12

Animal-based sources:
- Milk, curd, cheese
- Eggs
- Fish
- Chicken
- Red meat
- Liver

Fortified foods:
- Fortified cereals
- Fortified plant-based milk

Plant foods do not naturally contain vitamin B12.

--------------------------------------------------

TREATMENT AND PREVENTION

Treatment depends on severity:
- Mild deficiency: Oral B12 supplements
- Moderate to severe deficiency: High-dose supplements or injections

Preventive tips:
- Regular screening for vegetarians
- Adequate intake of fortified foods
- Timely supplementation if advised by a doctor

--------------------------------------------------

WHEN TO SEE A DOCTOR

Medical attention is necessary if:
- Symptoms of nerve involvement appear
- Blood tests show low or borderline B12
- Anemia is present
- Symptoms persist despite diet changes

--------------------------------------------------

FINAL NOTE

Vitamin B12 deficiency is common, easily diagnosed, and highly treatable.
Early detection prevents irreversible nerve damage and restores energy,
blood health, and neurological function.
