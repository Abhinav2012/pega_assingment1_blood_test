MANAGING HIGH CHOLESTEROL WITH DIET
AND SYMPTOMS SEEN IN BLOOD

High cholesterol is often called a “silent condition” because it usually shows
no obvious symptoms until serious problems develop. Despite this, it is one of
the leading risk factors for heart disease and stroke. The good news is that
cholesterol levels can be managed effectively with the right diet and lifestyle.

--------------------------------------------------

WHAT IS CHOLESTEROL?

Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance found in your blood. Your body needs
cholesterol to build cells and produce hormones, but too much of it can be harmful.

There are two main types of cholesterol:

LDL (Low-Density Lipoprotein):
Often called “bad cholesterol,” LDL builds up in the walls of arteries and
increases the risk of heart disease.

HDL (High-Density Lipoprotein):
Known as “good cholesterol,” HDL helps remove excess cholesterol from the blood.

Triglycerides:
Another type of fat in the blood that, when elevated, further increases heart risk.

--------------------------------------------------

WHAT DOES HIGH CHOLESTEROL MEAN IN BLOOD TESTS?

High cholesterol is detected through a lipid profile blood test.

Typical reference values:
Total Cholesterol: Less than 200 mg/dL
LDL Cholesterol: Less than 100 mg/dL
HDL Cholesterol:
Men: Above 40 mg/dL
Women: Above 50 mg/dL
Triglycerides: Less than 150 mg/dL

Abnormal blood findings may include:
- High LDL cholesterol
- Low HDL cholesterol
- Elevated triglycerides
- Increased total cholesterol

--------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS OF HIGH CHOLESTEROL

High cholesterol itself usually causes no symptoms. However, long-term elevation
can lead to serious conditions with noticeable signs:

- Chest pain (angina)
- Shortness of breath
- Fatigue on exertion
- Numbness or coldness in hands and feet
- Yellow fatty deposits around eyes or joints (xanthomas)
- High blood pressure
- Increased risk of heart attack and stroke

--------------------------------------------------

WHY DIET MATTERS IN CHOLESTEROL CONTROL

What you eat directly affects cholesterol levels in your blood. Diets high in
saturated fats, trans fats, and refined sugars increase LDL cholesterol, while
fiber-rich and healthy-fat foods help lower it.

--------------------------------------------------

FOODS TO EAT TO LOWER CHOLESTEROL

1. HIGH-FIBER FOODS
- Oats and oatmeal
- Barley
- Whole wheat and brown rice
- Fruits like apples, pears, and berries
- Vegetables like carrots and broccoli

Soluble fiber helps reduce LDL cholesterol absorption in the bloodstream.

--------------------------------------------------

2. HEALTHY FATS (REPLACE BAD FATS)

- Olive oil
- Mustard oil
- Groundnut oil
- Avocados
- Nuts like almonds and walnuts
- Seeds like flaxseed and chia seeds

These improve HDL (good cholesterol) and lower LDL.

--------------------------------------------------

3. OMEGA-3 RICH FOODS

- Fatty fish (salmon, sardines, mackerel)
- Flaxseeds
- Walnuts

Omega-3 fatty acids help reduce triglycerides and inflammation.

--------------------------------------------------

4. PLANT-BASED PROTEINS

- Lentils and dals
- Chickpeas and rajma
- Tofu and soy products

Replacing red meat with plant protein lowers cholesterol levels.

--------------------------------------------------

FOODS TO LIMIT OR AVOID

- Fried foods
- Bakery items and packaged snacks
- Butter, ghee (excess), cream
- Processed meats
- Sugary drinks and sweets
- Excess alcohol

--------------------------------------------------

SAMPLE CHOLESTEROL-FRIENDLY INDIAN DIET

Morning:
Warm water with soaked flaxseeds or oats

Breakfast:
Vegetable oats or whole-grain toast with curd

Lunch:
Dal or rajma, mixed vegetable sabzi, roti or brown rice, salad

Snack:
Fruit with a handful of nuts

Dinner:
Grilled fish or tofu, vegetables, light roti

--------------------------------------------------

WHEN DIET ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH

Diet and exercise are first-line treatments, but medication may be needed if:
- LDL cholesterol remains very high
- There is a family history of heart disease
- Diabetes or high blood pressure is present
- There is existing heart disease

Regular blood tests are essential to monitor progress.

--------------------------------------------------

FINAL NOTE

High cholesterol does not cause immediate symptoms, but its effects can be serious
and long-lasting. Managing it early through diet, exercise, and regular blood
tests can significantly reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke.
