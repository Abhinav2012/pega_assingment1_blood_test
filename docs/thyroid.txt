UNDERSTANDING THYROID IMBALANCES
AND SYMPTOMS SEEN IN BLOOD TESTS

The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland in the neck, but it plays a major
role in regulating metabolism, energy levels, heart rate, and overall hormonal
balance. Thyroid imbalances are common and often misunderstood, especially because
their symptoms can be vague and overlap with other conditions.

--------------------------------------------------

WHAT IS THE THYROID AND WHAT DOES IT DO?

The thyroid gland produces hormones that control how the body uses energy:
- T3 (Triiodothyronine)
- T4 (Thyroxine)

These hormones are regulated by TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone), which is released
by the pituitary gland. When thyroid hormone levels are low or high, TSH levels
change to compensate.

--------------------------------------------------

COMMON TYPES OF THYROID IMBALANCES

1. HYPOTHYROIDISM (UNDERACTIVE THYROID)

The thyroid does not produce enough hormones, causing body processes to slow down.

Common causes:
- Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (autoimmune)
- Iodine deficiency
- Certain medications
- Thyroid surgery or radiation

--------------------------------------------------

2. HYPERTHYROIDISM (OVERACTIVE THYROID)

The thyroid produces excessive hormones, causing body processes to speed up.

Common causes:
- Graves’ disease (autoimmune)
- Thyroid nodules
- Excess iodine intake
- Certain medications

--------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS OF THYROID IMBALANCES

Symptoms vary depending on whether the thyroid is underactive or overactive.

Hypothyroidism symptoms:
- Fatigue and sluggishness
- Weight gain
- Cold intolerance
- Dry skin and hair
- Hair loss
- Constipation
- Depression or low mood
- Slow heart rate

Hyperthyroidism symptoms:
- Weight loss despite normal appetite
- Heat intolerance
- Excessive sweating
- Anxiety and irritability
- Rapid or irregular heartbeat
- Tremors in hands
- Diarrhea
- Sleep disturbances

--------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS SEEN IN BLOOD TESTS

Thyroid problems are primarily diagnosed through blood tests.

Key thyroid blood markers:

TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone):
- High TSH indicates hypothyroidism
- Low TSH indicates hyperthyroidism

T4 (Free T4):
- Low in hypothyroidism
- High in hyperthyroidism

T3:
- May be low or normal in hypothyroidism
- Often elevated in hyperthyroidism

Thyroid Antibodies:
- Elevated TPO or Tg antibodies suggest autoimmune thyroid disease
  such as Hashimoto’s or Graves’ disease

Additional blood changes sometimes seen:
- High cholesterol (common in hypothyroidism)
- Low sodium levels
- Anemia
- Mild elevation of liver enzymes

--------------------------------------------------

WHY THYROID BALANCE IS IMPORTANT

Untreated thyroid imbalances can lead to:
- Heart problems
- Fertility issues
- Menstrual irregularities
- Mental health problems
- Bone loss (in hyperthyroidism)
- Severe fatigue and reduced quality of life

--------------------------------------------------

DIET AND LIFESTYLE SUPPORT FOR THYROID HEALTH

Foods that support thyroid function:
- Iodine-rich foods (iodized salt, dairy, eggs)
- Selenium-rich foods (Brazil nuts, sunflower seeds)
- Zinc-rich foods (nuts, legumes)
- Whole grains, fruits, and vegetables

Foods to limit:
- Excess soy (especially in hypothyroidism)
- Highly processed foods
- Excess sugar

Lifestyle tips:
- Regular exercise
- Stress management
- Adequate sleep
- Regular blood monitoring

--------------------------------------------------

WHEN TO SEE A DOCTOR

Medical evaluation is necessary if:
- Symptoms persist or worsen
- TSH is outside the normal range
- There is a family history of thyroid disease
- Pregnancy is planned or ongoing

Thyroid disorders often require long-term treatment and monitoring.

--------------------------------------------------

FINAL NOTE

Thyroid imbalances are common, manageable, and often lifelong conditions.
Early diagnosis through blood tests and proper treatment can help maintain
normal hormone levels and a healthy quality of life.
