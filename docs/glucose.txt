UNDERSTANDING BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS
AND SYMPTOMS SEEN IN BLOOD TESTS

Glucose is the primary source of energy for the body. Blood glucose levels reflect
how well the body regulates sugar, which is essential for normal brain function,
muscle activity, and overall metabolism. Abnormal glucose levels can indicate
diabetes, prediabetes, or other metabolic conditions.

--------------------------------------------------

WHAT IS GLUCOSE?

Glucose is a type of sugar that comes from the food we eat, especially carbohydrates.
After digestion, glucose enters the bloodstream and is transported into cells with
the help of insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas.

--------------------------------------------------

NORMAL BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS

Blood glucose is measured using different tests.

Fasting Blood Glucose:
Normal: 70–99 mg/dL
Prediabetes: 100–125 mg/dL
Diabetes: 126 mg/dL or higher

Post-Meal (2 hours after eating):
Normal: Below 140 mg/dL
Prediabetes: 140–199 mg/dL
Diabetes: 200 mg/dL or higher

HbA1c (3-month average glucose):
Normal: Below 5.7%
Prediabetes: 5.7–6.4%
Diabetes: 6.5% or higher

--------------------------------------------------

WHAT DO ABNORMAL GLUCOSE LEVELS MEAN?

High blood glucose (Hyperglycemia) may indicate:
- Prediabetes or diabetes
- Insulin resistance
- Poor dietary control
- Stress or illness
- Side effects of certain medications

Low blood glucose (Hypoglycemia) may be caused by:
- Skipping meals
- Excess insulin or diabetes medications
- Prolonged fasting
- Excess alcohol intake

--------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS OF HIGH BLOOD GLUCOSE

- Increased thirst
- Frequent urination
- Excessive hunger
- Fatigue
- Blurred vision
- Slow wound healing
- Recurrent infections
- Unintended weight loss

--------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS OF LOW BLOOD GLUCOSE

- Sweating
- Shakiness
- Dizziness
- Hunger
- Confusion
- Palpitations
- Anxiety
- In severe cases, loss of consciousness

--------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS SEEN IN BLOOD TESTS

Blood test abnormalities may include:
- Elevated fasting glucose
- High post-meal glucose
- Elevated HbA1c
- Presence of glucose in urine (in uncontrolled diabetes)

Additional findings sometimes seen:
- High triglycerides
- Low HDL cholesterol
- Mild kidney function changes

--------------------------------------------------

DIET AND LIFESTYLE SUPPORT FOR HEALTHY GLUCOSE LEVELS

Helpful dietary habits:
- Eat whole grains instead of refined carbohydrates
- Include high-fiber foods
- Balance meals with protein and healthy fats
- Limit sugar and sugary drinks

Lifestyle tips:
- Regular physical activity
- Weight management
- Adequate sleep
- Stress control

--------------------------------------------------

WHEN TO SEE A DOCTOR

Medical evaluation is important if:
- Blood glucose levels are consistently high or low
- Symptoms of diabetes appear
- HbA1c is in the prediabetic or diabetic range
- There is a family history of diabetes

--------------------------------------------------

FINAL NOTE

Blood glucose imbalance develops gradually and may go unnoticed for years.
Regular screening, healthy eating, and timely medical care can prevent
complications and support long-term metabolic health.
