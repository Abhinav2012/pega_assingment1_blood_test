WHAT LOW HEMOGLOBIN MEANS — AND WHAT YOU SHOULD EAT TO FIX IT

Feeling tired all the time? Getting breathless after climbing a few stairs?
Pale skin, frequent headaches, or dizziness?
One common but often ignored reason behind these symptoms is low hemoglobin.

--------------------------------------------------

WHAT IS HEMOGLOBIN?

Hemoglobin is a protein found in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs
to every part of the body. When hemoglobin levels are low, the body does not get
enough oxygen, leading to fatigue and weakness.

Normal Hemoglobin Levels:
Men: 13.5–17.5 g/dL
Women: 12.0–15.5 g/dL

Values below these ranges are considered low hemoglobin (anemia).

--------------------------------------------------

WHAT DOES LOW HEMOGLOBIN INDICATE?

Low hemoglobin usually means the body is:
- Not producing enough red blood cells
- Losing blood
- Lacking nutrients required to make hemoglobin

Common Causes:
- Iron deficiency (most common)
- Vitamin B12 or folate deficiency
- Heavy menstrual bleeding or blood loss
- Poor diet or poor nutrient absorption
- Chronic illnesses such as kidney disease or infections

--------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS OF LOW HEMOGLOBIN

- Constant tiredness
- Pale or yellowish skin
- Shortness of breath
- Dizziness or headaches
- Cold hands and feet
- Fast or irregular heartbeat
- Difficulty concentrating

--------------------------------------------------

WHAT TO EAT TO INCREASE HEMOGLOBIN

1. IRON-RICH FOODS (MOST IMPORTANT)

Vegetarian sources:
- Spinach, methi, amaranth (chaulai)
- Lentils, chickpeas, rajma
- Tofu and soybeans
- Pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds
- Dates, raisins, figs
- Jaggery (gur)

Non-vegetarian sources (better absorbed):
- Red meat
- Liver
- Chicken
- Fish
- Eggs (especially egg yolk)

--------------------------------------------------

2. VITAMIN C (IMPROVES IRON ABSORPTION)

- Amla
- Oranges and lemons
- Guava
- Tomatoes
- Bell peppers

Tip: Add lemon to spinach or dal, or eat fruit after meals.

--------------------------------------------------

3. VITAMIN B12 (ESSENTIAL FOR RED BLOOD CELLS)

- Milk, curd, cheese
- Eggs
- Fish and meat
- Fortified cereals

Strict vegetarians may need supplements after blood tests.

--------------------------------------------------

4. FOLATE (VITAMIN B9)

- Green leafy vegetables
- Beans and legumes
- Peanuts
- Avocados
- Beets

--------------------------------------------------

FOODS AND HABITS THAT REDUCE IRON ABSORPTION

- Tea and coffee
- Excess calcium taken with iron-rich meals
- Highly processed foods

Avoid tea or coffee 1–2 hours before and after meals.

--------------------------------------------------

SAMPLE HEMOGLOBIN-BOOSTING INDIAN DIET

Morning:
Soaked raisins and dates with amla or orange

Lunch:
Dal or rajma, spinach sabzi, rice or roti with lemon

Snack:
Roasted chana or peanuts with guava

Dinner:
Egg curry, chicken, or tofu with green vegetables and roti

--------------------------------------------------

WHEN DIET IS NOT ENOUGH

Diet alone may not be sufficient if:
- Hemoglobin is below 10 g/dL
- Symptoms are severe
- There is vitamin B12 deficiency or chronic illness

In such cases, supplements may be required under medical supervision.

--------------------------------------------------

FINAL NOTE

Low hemoglobin is common, treatable, and often reversible with proper nutrition
and medical care. Persistent fatigue should never be ignored.
